What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear stands out by combining productivity tools with wellness and habit-building features. Unlike apps such as Freedom or Cold Turkey that primarily focus on blocking distractions, Focus Bear offers a more holistic approach — encouraging users to take breaks, stay active, and build routines. It’s especially tailored for neurodivergent individuals, offering features like gamified progress tracking and habit checklists.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I’d choose Focus Bear if I wanted more than just a website blocker. Its focus on building healthy routines alongside productivity makes it a great all-in-one tool. The added structure, reminders, and mental health awareness features would be especially helpful for someone trying to balance focus and personal wellbeing.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Apps like Tiimo and Routinery offer highly visual daily planners, with customizable schedules that help users better visualize their day. Focus Bear currently lacks a detailed visual timeline, which could be beneficial for users who rely on visual structure to manage their time.

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
An area for improvement would be cross-device synchronization. Apps like Freedom allow users to block distractions across both mobile and desktop devices. If Focus Bear added this, it would provide a more seamless experience for users who switch between platforms during the day.
