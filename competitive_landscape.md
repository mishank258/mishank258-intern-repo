What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear stands out by combining productivity tools with wellness and habit-building features. Unlike apps such as Freedom or Cold Turkey that primarily focus on blocking distractions, Focus Bear offers a more holistic approach — encouraging users to take breaks, stay active, and build routines. It’s especially tailored for neurodivergent individuals, offering features like gamified progress tracking and habit checklists.

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I’d choose Focus Bear if I wanted more than just a website blocker. Its focus on building healthy routines alongside productivity makes it a great all-in-one tool. The added structure, reminders, and mental health awareness features would be especially helpful for someone trying to balance focus and personal wellbeing.

What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Apps like Tiimo and Routinery offer highly visual daily planners, with customizable schedules that help users better visualize their day. Focus Bear currently lacks a detailed visual timeline, which could be beneficial for users who rely on visual structure to manage their time.

Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
An area for improvement would be cross-device synchronization. Apps like Freedom allow users to block distractions across both mobile and desktop devices. If Focus Bear added this, it would provide a more seamless experience for users who switch between platforms during the day.

My experience
When I first opened the Freedom app, I noticed there is no direct login within the mobile app itself. Instead, the app directs you to the web version (Chrome) to sign in, which was a bit unexpected but manageable. Once logged in through the web dashboard, the mobile app’s interface was quite intuitive and easy to understand.

I found the session setup straightforward, with options to start a session immediately, schedule it for later, or set recurring sessions. The blocklists feature was clear and allowed me to create focused distraction blocks easily. Overall, despite the separate login process, the app felt well-designed and user-friendly, making it easy to manage digital distractions on my device. 

And according to me it does not have anything that basically put emphasis on ADHD but still its theme and the blog section on the front page was a bit attractive although it has similar features like focus bear, therefore focus bear has a bit more advanced features but they are a bit complicated as for a user to understand, Because people who have ADHD they already lack paying attention.
