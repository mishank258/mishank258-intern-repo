What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?

Daily Stand-ups: These are the short meetings in which each team member shares there accomplishment of previous days and future planning.
Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban): In sprint planning, selection and commitment of tasks is done by the team while in kanban the team pulls the backlog tasks which makes it more flexible to work.
Retrospectives: It reflects what went well and what did'nt, scopes of improvement. 
Backlog Refinement: A regular activity to keep the backlog up-to-date, well-defined, and prioritized. 

How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

Sharing recorded demos or meetings to accommodate time zone differences done using FireFiles.
Posting daily stand-up updates in discord channels to ensure everyone stays informed regardless of location.
Using asynchronus tools such as Github for updates and fast tracking.
Writing clear and concise documentation.

üìù Reflection
How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies create opportunities for team collaboration, planning, and reflection. They promote clear communication, early problem detection, and alignment, encouraging transparency and team unity.

Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
For me as an intern, daily stand-ups help the most. I get to share updates, understand what the team is working on, and feel supported by everyone.

üõ†Ô∏è Task
Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.
On the 23rd of July, our stand-up included an important security discussion. One teammate shared that they received a phishing email impersonating Jeremy, requesting Apple gift cards. This raised awareness across the team about phishing attacks. The rest of the updates followed the usual format‚Äîsharing what was done yesterday, what each person was working on today, and any blockers. Updates were clear and focused, but this incident emphasized the importance of vigilance around communication channels.<img width="1917" height="1078" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/066b56af-1685-4404-b651-33e8376df0c6" />



Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.
Since I couldn‚Äôt attend the retrospective meeting, I reviewed the notes shared on Firefiles. The team discussed overall progress and what each member was currently focused on. For instance, on 22nd July, one teammate had completed the 0th milestone, while others were actively preparing to tackle the 1st milestone. Reviewing these notes helped me stay in sync with team momentum and ensured I remained aligned with our next steps.

Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
I will start asking teammates if they need help when I finish my tasks early, to support team progress.
