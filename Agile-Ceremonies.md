Agile ceremonies create opportunities for team collaboration, planning, and reflection. They promote clear communication, early problem detection, and alignment, encouraging transparency and team unity.

Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
For me as an intern, daily stand-ups help the most. I get to share updates, understand what the team is working on, and feel supported by everyone.
