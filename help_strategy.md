# ðŸ“Œ When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?

## When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
I usually use AI when I need quick explanations, code snippets, or multiple perspectives on a problem. Google is my go-to for documentation, tutorials, and verifying solutions from trusted sources. AI helps me save time, but Google gives more context and references.

## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
I ask a colleague when the problem involves sensitive information, company-specific systems, or something that might require brainstorming. If the issue is urgent and I cannot solve it on my own, a colleague can guide me faster than searching online.

## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
Troubleshooting alone can be slow, especially with complex bugs or unclear errors. Developers might overlook simple mistakes, struggle with unfamiliar tools, or waste time on solutions that donâ€™t fit the project. It can also be isolating without feedback from others.

## Usefulness of AI
During my 30-minute session with ChatGPT, I learned that AI can be very helpful in coding when I need quick explanations, code snippets, or debugging hints. It is useful for learning new libraries, summarizing documentation, and experimenting with unfamiliar patterns. However, AI is not ideal for handling sensitive information, solving project-specific logic, or making complex architectural decisions. Its suggestions can sometimes be generic, outdated, or contain errors, so verification and critical thinking are essential. Overall, AI works best as a supporting tool to speed up repetitive tasks and provide guidance, but it should not replace reasoning or problem-solving skills.
