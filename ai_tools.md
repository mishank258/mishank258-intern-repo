Which AI tools did you try?
I used GitHub Copilot in VS Code and ChatGPT. I didn’t explore Claude AI, as it offers similar functionality to ChatGPT and I preferred sticking with tools that integrate better into my current workflow.

What worked well? What didn’t?
I'm already comfortable using ChatGPT — it’s been very effective for explaining coding concepts and helping debug logic errors.  
I also used GitHub Copilot for a basic task to print prime numbers. It was useful for auto-suggesting code and helped me complete the task faster. While it worked well for simple, well-known logic, it sometimes needed reviewing to ensure accuracy.

When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
AI can be used for typing the code which is reptitve and unusual, learning and uunderstanding of the unfamiliar topics, debugging and speeding up the basic and simple coding tasks.
However, I’ve learned that AI should be treated as a support tool. It’s still important to understand the code, review suggestions critically, and not rely completely on AI for complex logic or architecture decisions.
