VS Code Productivity Shortcuts
## Navigation
- **Ctrl + P**: Quickly open files by name without browsing folders.
- **Ctrl + Tab**: Switch between your recently opened files.
- **Ctrl + G**: Jump directly to a specific line number.
## Editing
- **Alt + Click**: Insert multiple cursors for simultaneous editing.
- **Ctrl + /**: Comment or uncomment the selected line(s).
- **Shift + Alt + ↓ / ↑**: Duplicate the current line down or up.
- **Ctrl + D**: Select and edit the next occurrence of the highlighted word.

Out of these, I believe **multiple cursors (Alt + Click)** and **quick file navigation (Ctrl + P)** will be the most useful in my daily workflow, since they allow me to quickly move around and edit code much faster than using a mouse.
Keyboard shortcuts help improve productivity by keeping my hands on the keyboard and reducing context switching. This means fewer interruptions, faster editing, and smoother coding sessions overall.
