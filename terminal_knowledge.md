Set up a terminal client of your choice (e.g., iTerm2 + zsh on Mac, Windows Terminal + PowerShell, or any other).
Windows Terminal with PowerShell 7 because it is powerful, customizable, and works well on Windows.

Customize it if desired (e.g., themes, aliases, plugins).
Created aliases (`ll`, `c`, `pwd`, `..`, `hello`) to speed up common tasks and installed `posh-git` to show Git branch and status in the prompt.

What was the most useful command you learned today?
`Set-Alias` for creating command shortcuts, Navigating directories with `cd` and `..` and Using Git commands in the terminal (`git status`).
