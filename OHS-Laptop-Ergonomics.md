What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?
Several risks are involved such as neck strain from constantly looking down, poor posture, wrist discomfort and eyestrain as well. And if the screen is splitted in the laptop it can cause a lot of discomfort while using external monitor really helps.

What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)
Laptop stands can raise the screen to eye level which can really reduce the eye strain and neck posture, external keybaord and mouse can help in keeping the wrists neutral and arms relaxed, chair helps in upright posture and while the adjustable desk also helps to alternate between sitting and standing positions.

What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?
For every individual different adjustments are made according to their own comfort, for me monitor height should be a little below the eye level, chair height should be the maximum, knees at 90 degrees and relaxed arms on sides. While for the desk setup screen should be about an arms length away and external keyboard should be easily accesible while sitting comfortably.

What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)
The most important is 20-20-20 rule that is every 20 mins, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Stectrching every 30 to 60 mins and posture checks.

üìù Reflection
What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
To improve my workspace setup, I added an external monitor for better multitasking and paired it with a wireless keyboard and mouse to maintain ergonomic hand positioning. I elevated my laptop using a stand to keep the screen at eye level, which helps reduce neck strain. To further enhance comfort, I added cushions to my chair‚Äôs armrests for wrist and elbow support and attached a car-style neck pillow to support my neck and upper back. These changes have significantly increased both comfort and focus during long work sessions.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
I began sitting with my feet flat and back straight, taking breaks every hour to stretch and do quick shoulder rolls. I also adjusted my screen height to match eye level.

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
I plan to use Focus Bear to support my well-being during work by setting reminders every 45 minutes to take a movement break and every 2 hours to check my posture. Additionally, I‚Äôve set up a timer to help me balance focused work sessions with regular breaks, ensuring sustained productivity and reduced physical strain throughout the day.

üõ†Ô∏è Task
Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.
I adjusted my laptop setup according to ergonomic best practices by adding a laptop cooling stand, which not only helps with heat management but also raises the screen to a comfortable eye level, reducing neck strain. I already had a desk and chair in place, and to further improve my workspace, I added a portable external monitor for increased screen space and connected a mouse and keyboard to maintain an ergonomic typing posture.

Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
One piece of equipment that significantly improved my posture and comfort is a laptop cooling stand. It raises the screen to eye level, reducing neck strain and promoting a more upright sitting posture. Additionally, it helps with device cooling during long work sessions.

Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)
For this task, I followed posture and movement reminders manually by keeping an eye on the clock. I tried to follow the 20-20-20 rule and included regular stretching throughout the day. However, I occasionally forgot to take breaks or check my posture, which impacted consistency. I plan to start using Focus Bear soon, as its built-in reminders will help me stay on track more effectively and ensure I maintain healthy habits throughout the workday.

Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
I started implementing regular movement and posture checks by following the 20-20-20 rule‚Äîevery 20 minutes, I looked 20 feet away for 20 seconds‚Äîand stretching every hour. Although I initially relied on checking the time manually, I plan to use Focus Bear to automate these reminders and ensure consistency.
