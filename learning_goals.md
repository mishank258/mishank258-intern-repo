I hope to gain practical, hands-on experience in a professional environment and better understand how projects are managed end-to-end in a real-world setting. I also want to learn how teams collaborate effectively to deliver high-quality outcomes.

I’m most excited to develop my problem-solving, technical, and communication skills. I’d also like to improve my ability to work on tasks independently while staying aligned with the team’s goals.

I can bring a strong work ethic, adaptability, and a willingness to learn. I’m proactive in asking questions, open to feedback, and ready to assist wherever needed to help the team achieve its objectives.

I feel less confident when it comes to asking for help quickly, as I often try to solve problems alone for too long. I’d like to improve my ability to reach out earlier and communicate blockers effectively.

One past experience that pushed me to grow was during a group project where we were building a Building Management System (BMS) website. Part-way through, one teammate dropped out and the other didn’t contribute — leaving me to handle everything. I took ownership of planning, assigning any remaining tasks, and developing the entire website myself. It was a challenge balancing all the responsibilities at once, but the experience taught me a lot about staying adaptable, managing pressure, and taking initiative to see things through.

Success for me would mean contributing meaningfully to the team’s projects, learning new skills that I can carry forward, and building confidence in a professional setting. It would also mean leaving with strong relationships and positive feedback from my team.
