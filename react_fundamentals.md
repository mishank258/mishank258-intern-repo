# ðŸ“Œ Navigation with React Router

## What are the advantages of client-side routing?
Client-side routing makes websites feel faster and smoother because the browser doesnâ€™t need to reload the entire page when moving between sections. Instead, only the parts that change are updated, which gives a more app-like experience. It also allows developers to manage different views inside a single-page application, keeping the userâ€™s experience seamless. Another advantage is that it reduces server load since fewer full-page requests are made, and features like animations or transitions between pages become easier to implement.

Installed React Router and set up a basic routing system in my React app. We created two pages, Home.js and Profile.js, and added navigation between them using Link/useNavigate. This allowed smooth switching between pages without reloading the browser. Finally, I pushed my navigation setup to GitHub to save and share the project.
