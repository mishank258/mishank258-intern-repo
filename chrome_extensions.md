Which extensions did you install? Why?

**React Developer Tools**  
I added this extension to better inspect the structure of React applications. It allows me to view components, props, state, and hooks directly within the browser.

**Redux DevTools**
I installed this to help visualize and debug Redux state. It clearly shows actions being dispatched and how the state evolves, which makes troubleshooting easier.

**JSON Viewer**
This tool improves the readability of raw JSON responses from APIs by formatting them into a clean, structured layout.

**Lighthouse**
I used Lighthouse to analyze website performance, accessibility, and SEO. It provides detailed reports and practical suggestions to improve web app quality.

What was the most useful thing you learned?
The most helpful insight was seeing how React Developer Tools lets me interactively explore the component tree and track props or hooks in real time.  
Lighthouse also stood out by revealing performance and accessibility issues that aren't obvious during development, like unnecessary render-blocking resources or missing accessibility tags.

**As in the screenshot it can be clearly seen I installed the extensions.**
