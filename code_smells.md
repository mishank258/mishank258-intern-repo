# Code Smells Reflection

## What code smells did you find in your code?

I found some common code smells like:
- **Magic Numbers:** Using hardcoded values like 3.14 instead of constants.
- **Long Functions:** Functions doing too many things at once.
- **Duplicate Code:** Same code repeated in different places.
- **Large Classes (God Objects):** Classes trying to do too much.
- **Deeply Nested Conditionals:** Many if/else inside each other making code hard to read.
- **Commented-Out Code:** Old code left in comments that is not used.
- **Inconsistent Naming:** Variable and function names that are not clear.

## How did refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of the code?
Refactoring helped by:
- Breaking long functions into smaller, easier parts.
- Removing duplicate code by using shared functions.
- Splitting large classes into smaller classes with clear jobs.
- Using early returns to reduce nested if/else and make code simpler.
- Deleting commented-out code to keep things clean.
- Giving variables and functions clear names.
This made the code easier to read, understand, and change.

## How can avoiding code smells make future debugging easier?
Avoiding code smells helps by:
- Making bugs easier to find and fix.
- Reducing chances of bugs spreading to other parts.
- Making code clear so I or others donâ€™t waste time guessing.
- Having less repeated code means fewer places for bugs to hide.

This results in more reliable and easier-to-maintain code.

As the codes can clearly been seen in the screenshots, with the refracted codes.
