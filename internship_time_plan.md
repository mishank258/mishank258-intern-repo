# Internship Time Plan

## Overview
To meet the internship requirement of 120–140 hours, I have developed a detailed weekly schedule. All work will be completed remotely and logged in **Focus Bear** for evidence. The schedule slightly exceeds the minimum requirement to allow flexibility for academic commitments or unforeseen events.
