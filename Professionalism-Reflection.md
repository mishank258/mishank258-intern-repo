If I need a response or action from colleagues or supervisors, I would begin by sending a polite follow-up via email or Discord after waiting for about 1‚Äì2 business days. In the message, I‚Äôd clearly restate my request, include any necessary context, and highlight any deadlines or urgency. If there‚Äôs still no reply, I‚Äôd switch to another method‚Äîlike tagging them in a relevant Discord channel or sending a direct message. If the matter is still unresolved and it's urgent or causing delays, I‚Äôd escalate it by reaching out to my team lead or supervisor, explaining the situation and the steps I‚Äôve taken so far, and asking for their help to move things along.

What are some things you won't do?
There are several things I won‚Äôt do to maintain professionalism and integrity in a team setting. I won‚Äôt share confidential or sensitive information without proper authorization, and I won‚Äôt ignore deadlines or allow communication delays to hinder progress. I also won‚Äôt escalate issues without first making a reasonable effort to resolve them directly with the person involved. Additionally, I won‚Äôt engage in unprofessional or disrespectful behavior, even when faced with challenges, and I won‚Äôt make assumptions without first clarifying expectations or seeking additional information when needed.
