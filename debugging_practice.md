 # ðŸ“Œ Practise React Debugging in a Test Repo
 ## What was the issue?
 The issue was that the Counter component was directly modifying a state variable instead of using the useState setter function. Specifically, count++ was used, which caused the runtime error.

## What debugging method did you use?
This indicated that a constant value was being reassigned.
Inspected the code:
I looked at the increment function in the Counter component and noticed that the state variable count was being directly modified using count++.
React documentation and DevTools:
I confirmed that state variables returned by useState are immutable and must be updated using the setter function setCount.
Trial and error:
I temporarily added console.log(count) inside the increment function to see the value changes and verify that the state was not updating correctly when modified directly.

## How did you resolve the problem?
Initially, the increment function tried to increase the count variable directly using count++. This caused an error because count is a constant returned by useState and cannot be modified directly.
To fix the problem, I used the setter function setCount provided by useState to update the state: setCount(count + 1). This is the correct way to change state in React, and it ensures the component re-renders with the updated value.
