Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes, I have used Git in a university unit for software devices while working on mobile app development projects.

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I chose VS Code's built-in Git client because it’s integrated into the editor, making it easy to visualize changes, stage commits, and push updates without switching tools.

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
I learned how Git keeps track of changes using a three-step workflow (working directory → staging area → commit). Understanding how files move through these stages made it clear why you can choose exactly which changes to commit, and how easy it is to revert or update code without losing work.
