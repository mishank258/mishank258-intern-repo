üîç Research & Learn
What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?
Remote workers face threats like phishing attacks, weak or reused passwords, and unsecured Wi-Fi. Outdated software can be exploited, and lost or unprotected devices risk exposing sensitive data.

What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?
To keep your devices and accounts secure, use strong and unique passwords for every account and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. Keep your software and devices updated to patch security vulnerabilities. Use a trusted password manager to store credentials safely. Always lock your screen when stepping away, and avoid using public Wi-Fi without a VPN to protect your data.

Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?
Locking your computer when you're away prevents others from accessing sensitive data, sending messages, or making changes without your permission. It protects your work, personal information, and company systems from unauthorized access and potential misuse.

How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?
If you get a phishing message or suspicious link, don‚Äôt click or download anything. Check the sender‚Äôs identity and report the message to your IT team or use the email‚Äôs report feature, then delete it. Watch for signs like urgent language or mistakes. Being careful helps protect you and the company from risks.

What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?
A strong password is long, uses a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and doesn‚Äôt include easy-to-guess info like names or birthdays. Using a password manager helps you create, store, and autofill strong, unique passwords for every account safely, so you don‚Äôt have to remember them all.

Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, like a code from your phone, in addition to your password. It helps protect your accounts even if your password is stolen. You should enable 2FA on all important accounts, especially email, work tools, and banking.

üìù Reflection
What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication on important accounts. I also keep my software updated and avoid clicking on suspicious links. To improve, I can start using a password manager to better organize passwords and set up automatic screen locking on all my devices.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
To make secure behavior a habit, I can set reminders to update passwords regularly, use tools like password managers to simplify security tasks, and always pause to think before clicking links or sharing information. Building these actions into my daily routine helps keep security automatic and natural.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
I will use strong, unique passwords for every account and store them in a trusted password manager. I‚Äôll enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, avoid reusing passwords, and regularly review and update credentials for old or unused accounts.

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
If I suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on my account, I would immediately change my password, enable or review two-factor authentication, and log out of all sessions. I‚Äôd report the incident to the IT or security team and monitor my account for any further unusual behavior.

üõ†Ô∏è Task
Ensure your work accounts have strong passwords and enable 2FA where possible.
I will update all my work accounts with strong, unique passwords and ensure two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled wherever possible to add an extra layer of security.

Review your password storage method‚Äîif you‚Äôre not using a password manager, consider setting one up.
I currently use Google Password Manager to store some of my passwords, which provides basic convenience and security. However, to improve protection and better manage complex, unique passwords across accounts, I plan to explore using a dedicated password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password.

Set up your computer and phone to automatically lock (require a password or biometric login) if you are away for more than a few minutes
I‚Äôve configured my computer and phone to automatically lock after a few minutes of inactivity. Both require a password or biometric login (like fingerprint or face recognition) to unlock, helping protect sensitive information if I step away or lose my device.

Document one new cyber security habit you will follow at Focus Bear.
One new cyber security habit I will follow at Focus Bear is to pause and carefully inspect all links and attachments in emails before clicking them, especially if the message seems urgent or unexpected. This will help me avoid phishing attempts and protect company data.
