What is a ‚ÄúUser Manual for Me‚Äù, and why do teams use them?
A ‚ÄúUser Manual for Me‚Äù is a short guide that explains how someone works best ‚Äî like their communication style, working hours, and preferences. Teams use it to understand each other better, work more smoothly together, and avoid confusion or misunderstandings.

What categories are helpful to include? (e.g., communication style, work habits, feedback preferences)
Helpful categories in a ‚ÄúUser Manual for Me‚Äù include your communication style (e.g., short messages or emails), work habits (like best focus times or distractions), and feedback preferences (such as gentle or direct, public or private). Sharing your collaboration style (like liking clear roles or avoiding last-minute tasks) is also useful. Adding fun facts or personality traits can help teammates connect and work better together.

How can writing a personal user manual improve teamwork and reduce misunderstandings?
Writing a personal user manual helps teammates understand how you work, communicate, and like to receive feedback. This reduces confusion, avoids mistakes, and builds trust. When everyone shares their preferences, it‚Äôs easier to work together, respect each other‚Äôs needs, and support one another better.

üìù Reflection
What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)
To do my best work, I need clear and direct communication, flexibility with time and tasks, detailed instructions when starting something new, and minimal interruptions so I can stay focused.

How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)
I prefer async messages for most things so I can reply in my own time. For important topics, I like short video calls or quick check-ins to stay aligned.

What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)
A silent workplace with lo-fi music playing and surrounded by windows without curtains in the evening helps me stay focused and productive.

How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)
I‚Äôm comfortable giving and receiving feedback both verbally and in writing. During meetings, I prefer verbal feedback, while for other times, I find written feedback through emails more helpful.

What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)
Some quirks of my work style are that I like to take time to process ideas before responding, I sometimes prefer brainstorming out loud to explore thoughts, and I find written instructions helpful to refer back to later.

üìù User Manual for Me
User Manual for Ishank Malhotra

My role
I am a Front-End Developer intern. Right now, I‚Äôm working on GitHub introductory milestones and personal projects like a Pi assistant, some Python games, and others.  
The days and times I work are:  
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays during office hours, and sometimes on weekends when a day is skipped.

How I Work Best
I work best under pressure, managing it by focusing while sitting at my desk and working during the evenings. I also make sure to take time to relax.
I struggle when I have too much time left to complete tasks because it makes me less motivated.

Communication Style
I prefer messages to be clear, short, and to the point, with a clear explanation of what needs to be done.  
The best way to reach me is by call, email, or Discord.  
If something is urgent, just call me‚ÄîI‚Äôll respond quickly and directly.

Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team when everyone understands their role, communicates positively, and helps each other complete tasks by sharing ideas and feedback.  
My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is when people don‚Äôt contribute or avoid responsibility.  
If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I have no comments or questions at that time.

Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by working alongside someone who is determined and focused.  
I get distracted very easily by many small things around me.  
The best way to support my productivity is to have someone working hard alongside me, which motivates me to do the same.

Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be direct, clear, and to the point‚Äîwhether verbal or written‚Äîideally with examples so I can understand exactly what to improve.  
When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is to tell me directly (privately if possible) and explain what went wrong and how I can fix it.  
I appreciate it when teammates give honest feedback, help me learn from mistakes, and support me in growing and improving rather than just pointing out faults.

Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is that I'm not paying attention or skipping meetings. But that‚Äôs not true‚ÄîI go through all the meeting content every time, even if I miss a session, and stay up to date.  
A fun fact about me is that I often pretend I don‚Äôt know much, but I actually know more than I show.  
My work superpower is staying calm under pressure and getting things done even in tight situations.
