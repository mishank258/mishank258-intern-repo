# Research best debugging techniques for React applications.

## Explore tools like React DevTools, browser console, and VS Code debugger.
When working with React, there are a few tools that really help with debugging. React DevTools lets you check the component tree, see props and state, and understand how updates happen. The browser console is useful for spotting errors, logging values, and keeping track of warnings. VS Code debugger helps set breakpoints and step through code to see exactly where things go wrong. Using these tools together makes finding and fixing problems much easier.

## Learn about error boundaries and how to handle runtime errors.
Sometimes a runtime error can break the whole React app. Error boundaries are components that catch these errors and show a fallback UI instead of crashing everything. They let you isolate the problem to just one part of the app and also log the error for later. This makes the app more stable and avoids a bad experience for users.

## Investigate debugging performance issues using the React Profiler.
The React Profiler helps you find performance problems in your app. It shows how often components render and how long each render takes. This way, you can see which components are slowing things down or rendering too much. By fixing these, your app becomes faster and smoother, which is really important for bigger React projects.

## What are the most common debugging techniques?
The usual way to debug React apps is by logging values with console.log, checking errors in the browser console, and using breakpoints to step through the code. Inspecting props and state carefully and following the component hierarchy also helps a lot. Another common technique is temporarily commenting out code to isolate where the problem is happening.

## Which tools are most effective for React debugging?
The best tools are React DevTools for checking the component tree, browser console for errors and warnings, and VS Code debugger for stepping through code. For performance issues, the React Profiler is really useful. Together, these tools make it faster to find and fix issues.

## How do you debug issues in large React codebases?
In big projects, itâ€™s important to break the app into smaller components and check each part individually. Using Error Boundaries helps catch problems without crashing the whole app. Tools like React DevTools and Profiler are essential to track state, props, and rendering patterns. Writing clear, modular code also makes debugging much easier.

When I was building my Redux counter demo, I ran into a problem where the counter value wasnâ€™t updating even though the reducer logic looked fine. To figure it out, I opened React DevTools and checked the component tree. I saw that the state in the Redux store was updating correctly, but the Counter component wasnâ€™t re-rendering because I was using the wrong selector name (selectCounter instead of selectCount). Once I spotted that in DevTools, I fixed the import and everything started working. That experience showed me how powerful DevTools is for catching small mistakes that are hard to spot just by reading code.
