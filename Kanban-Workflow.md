üîç Research & Learn
How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board visualizes the workflow of tasks across different stages which helps in tracking the progress and reduce the overload as it shows what has been completed and what has to be completed. This is it imprves the workflow and helps in avoiding delays.

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
These coulmns on kanban board represents Backlog which is task has not been started yet, In progress is tasks are being worked on, Blocked stuck or waiting, Done is Completed task.

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
They are moved from left to right and the person working on them updates them.

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
It helps in reducing multitasking, easier to identifing the order of work to be done, helps to keep focus on the main tasks.

üìù Reflection
How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban shows what has to be done which makes the priorities clear by keeping the WIP limited which avoids overload.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I will work on less tasks at a time which will improve the efficiency and update the board everytime I work on it.

üõ†Ô∏è Task
Check out Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)
The GitHub Projects for Focus Bear are structured around clearly defined milestones, which are accessible via the Issues tab. Each milestone marks a distinct stage in the internship journey. For example, Milestone 0 includes onboarding activities such as "Working in an Agile team" and understanding "Company Policies", while Milestone 1 focuses on learning about the Focus Bear platform and setting personal goals. This structured approach continues up to Milestone 8, with each containing multiple tasks to be completed in sequence. Tasks progress through columns labeled To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done, offering a transparent view of the workflow and individual progress.<img width="1879" height="826" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63cfcd30-675b-467f-81ee-8e2ec1a4dd23" />

Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.
These tasks have been completed so moved to closed and completed.

In one of the tasks I slept while completing it, so I labelled that to documentation, so when woke up I continued my work.

Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
I will breakdown the tasks into parts which will improve clarity and efficiency and start including clearer labels and due dates on each task and link them to milestones.
