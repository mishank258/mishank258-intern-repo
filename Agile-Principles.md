What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is a flexible approach to software development that focuses on collaboration, quick feedback, and continuous improvement. Agile works in smaller cycles (called sprints or iterations) to deliver value quickly and adapt to changes while traditional project management followed a linear sequence of phases involving requirements, design, devlpment, testing and deployment.

What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)
The Agile Manifesto values people and their communication more than relying on strict processes or tools. It prioritizes creating functional software over producing detailed documents, encourages working closely with customers instead of sticking to formal contracts, and prefers adapting to changes rather than rigidly following a set plan.
Agile also follows 12 key principles:
Deliver working software frequently.  
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.  
Business people and developers must work together daily.  
Build projects around motivated individuals and trust them to do the job.  
Face-to-face communication is the best way to share information.  
Working software is the main measure of progress.  
Agile promotes sustainable development with a constant pace.  
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  
Simplicity‚Äîthe art of maximizing the amount of work not done‚Äîis essential.  
The best solutions come from self-organizing teams.  
Teams should regularly reflect on how to improve and adjust accordingly.

What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
Scrum follows a structured approach with short, time-bound sprints (typically lasting 1‚Äì2 weeks), clearly assigned roles like the Product Owner and Scrum Master, and regular meetings such as daily stand-ups and sprint reviews. It's most effective for teams that are aiming to meet defined goals within a set timeframe.
Kanban focuses on visualizing the workflow through a board, limits work in progress, and does not require fixed roles or time-boxed planning. It's ideal for ongoing work with frequently shifting priorities.

Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
Focus Bear chooses Kanban because the team works with an ongoing stream of tasks instead of fixed sprint cycles. Since priorities can change quickly due to feedback or business demands, Kanban‚Äôs flexibility allows for easier adjustments. The visual board and limits on work in progress help the team stay organized and minimize context switching. Overall, Kanban aligns well with the dynamic and fast-moving environment of a small startup.

üìù Reflection
What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
Agile offers several advantages, such as delivering useful features to users more quickly, improving teamwork across roles, staying adaptable to changing needs, and fostering a sense of ownership within the team. However, it also comes with challenges like requiring clear and consistent communication, managing uncertainty in planning, and the possibility of it being applied incorrectly without the right mindset or guidance.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
As a frontend developer intern, Agile allows me to break tasks into manageable pieces and release changes more quickly. It helps me collect feedback sooner, which improves the overall user experience. The approach also promotes strong collaboration with designers and backend teams. Agile encourages ongoing learning and improvement, and its flexibility makes it easier to adapt when design or user flow adjustments are needed.

üõ†Ô∏è Task
Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
Scrum is a method that uses fixed-length sprints, has set roles like Product Owner and Scrum Master, and regular meetings to help the team reach specific goals on time. Kanban is more flexible as it shows work on a visual board, limits how much work is happening at once, and lets work flow continuously without strict roles or deadlines. It‚Äôs good for teams dealing with ongoing tasks that change often.

Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
The Agile principle that I think will help me most is breaking down my frontend work into smaller parts. This way, I can deliver updates faster, get feedback early, and make improvements step by step. It helps me stay organized and adapt quickly to any changes the team needs.
