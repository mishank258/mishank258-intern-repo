# ðŸ“Œ Testing Redux with Jest
## What was the most challenging part of testing Redux?
The most challenging part of testing Redux was understanding how reducers work as pure functions. At first, I was thinking in terms of UI, but in Redux you just feed state + action and check the new state. Once I got that, it felt easy.

## How do Redux tests differ from React component tests?
Redux tests differ from React component tests because they donâ€™t involve rendering or the DOM. Component tests are about what shows up on the screen, but Redux tests are only about state changes and making sure actions dispatch correctly.

I tested the counter reducer by checking if state updated when actions like increment and incrementByAmount were dispatched. For async, I mocked dispatch and confirmed that incrementAsync eventually called the right action with the value I passed.

# ðŸ“Œ Mocking API Calls in Jest
## Why is it important to mock API calls in tests?
Mocking API calls is important because it lets me test how my components behave without actually hitting a real server. This makes tests faster, more reliable, and safe, especially when dealing with sensitive data or when the API isnâ€™t ready yet.

## What are some common pitfalls when testing asynchronous code?
Some common pitfalls when testing asynchronous code are forgetting to wait for the data to load, not handling promises correctly, or tests passing before the async code finishes. This can lead to flaky tests that sometimes fail even if the code works fine.

For the demo, I created a React component that fetches data from a fake API. In the test, I used jest.mock() to replace the real API call with a mock function that returns sample data. Then I checked that the component correctly displayed the mocked data without making an actual network request. This way, I verified the componentâ€™s behavior safely and quickly.
