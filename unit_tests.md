# ðŸ“Œ Testing Redux with Jest
## What was the most challenging part of testing Redux?
The most challenging part of testing Redux was understanding how reducers work as pure functions. At first, I was thinking in terms of UI, but in Redux you just feed state + action and check the new state. Once I got that, it felt easy.

## How do Redux tests differ from React component tests?
Redux tests differ from React component tests because they donâ€™t involve rendering or the DOM. Component tests are about what shows up on the screen, but Redux tests are only about state changes and making sure actions dispatch correctly.

I tested the counter reducer by checking if state updated when actions like increment and incrementByAmount were dispatched. For async, I mocked dispatch and confirmed that incrementAsync eventually called the right action with the value I passed.
